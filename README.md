Made a Reddit client app for Android. Used the open source Reddit API wrapper JRAW to access Reddit's API. Users can log in or just browse Reddit without logging in. When the user is logged in they can post submissions, reply to posts and comments, subscribe and unsubscribe from subreddits and vote up/down on posts. Includes a widget to browse the latest posts quickly. Uses the Picasso image library for handling images. Set up a content provider backed by SQLite to handle posts and comments. Requests to the API are done using Async Tasks.
