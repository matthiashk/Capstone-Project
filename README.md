Made a Reddit client app for Android.<br/>
Used the open source Reddit API wrapper JRAW to access Reddit's API.<br/>
Users can log in or browse Reddit without logging in.<br/>
When the user is logged in they can 
* Post submissions 
* Reply to posts and comments
* Subscribe and unsubscribe from subreddits 
* Vote up/down on posts

Includes a widget to browse the latest posts quickly.<br/> 
Uses the Picasso image library for handling images.<br/>
Set up a content provider backed by SQLite to handle posts and comments.<br/>
Requests to the API are done using Async Tasks.
